                            <p> My friend doesn't want to play modded terraria but i do so i am wondering if I can have both so that I can play with him and be able to play modded with other people. I accidentally replaced the terraria launcher file with the tmodloader one. is there any way to get the regular launcher. so, i used to have this mod a long time ago, and i want to re-install it, but it is not updated for 1.3 and doesn't look like it is going to be. is there another mod i can use to roll back to the really old versions of terraria? i got terraria just before 1.1 came out, maybe a month or two before, and i want to go back and experience that again. Hello everyone! As some of you may know there was this thing called Terraria game launcher which allowed you to play older versions of Terraria (legally). As I researched it turned out it stopped working as of terraria 1.3 making it impossible to actually use game launcher. Today I am bringing you a guide of how you can use the Game launcher and enjoy the older versions of the game! Prepping: 1. Backup your saves!!! You can find them in \Users\(user name)\Documents\My Games. As the title states, what are some good games to play with a 9 year old (online/co-op/multiplayer)? Games we've already exhausted. 1. Fortnite 2. Minecraft 3. Trove 4. Roblox 5. Left 4 Dead 2 6. Terarria I was thinking that some sort of kid-friendly dungeon crawler (co-op/multiplayer of course) would be pretty neat. Anything that is "9 year old friendly" would be nice though. Thank. Does anyone have any simple mod suggestions. I have been searching and looking for this, Is there a cheat sheet for terraria game launcher? because tmodloader crashed when i had installed a mod that had storage in, So do any of you know about. 
I'm interested in modding Terraria but i'm afraid it would mess up my saves and the game itself. i do have a couple of questions, however: 1: Is it safe? 2: How do I start? 3: Would my saves be safe? 4: Is it possible to revert the modded Terraria back to the vanilla one? if so, how do you do it? 5: do some mods have viruses or things that would mess my computer up 6: will I be able to play with vanilla players? 7: Is it possible to mod the game in Steam? We have banked over 800 hours together playing Don't Starve, but she has gotten bored of it. In all reality, she prefers fighting and collecting resources, but likes having a place to come home to, which I usually build and maintain. PC would be nice, but I'd be willing to get us onto another platform game if it was the right. The other post I meant: The mods thread: Have fun everyone! (obviously requires tAPI, which you can find here:. Does anybody know what I'm doing wrong. Title. I think theres alot of overlap in the fanbase. Will we see a decline in activity here? Maybe the console release will help sustain 
I've done exactly what I was told too when installing both, yet nothing works, I can't launch terraria after the launcher GUI has appeared, and it doesn't pick up the mod files. Please. I just released the application which allows your servers to be viewable on a server list application. Users can then double click on the server entry and Terraria will launch and connect them to your server!
