                            <p> I have access to a 3D printer and I'm looking for fun Zootopia models, and the FIRST thing i thought of was the train, does anyone Hi everyone, I’m wanting to commission two rigged 3d models one for me and one for my girlfriend and was hoping I could find some suggestions for good artists. I also know blender has a similar tool to the one used to create the fur layer on the models used to render zootopia. I was hoping to find an artist that uses that (or another similar) tool, so that our models have a nice fur layer rather than just one implied by shaping. Thanks in advance 
I started keeping track of what I watched in theaters when I was 10 years old in 2003 but those were on scraps of paper and now lost. I have a digital record up to the start of 2008. I have a log of every film I saw since the start of 2010 but all my 2000s data is lost. I'll share my complete 2010s stuff in 2 years when the decade wraps up (I've watched roughly 2.5k films, though I'm not sure how many different films, probably 2k). Bold titles are my #1s of the year. (https://letterboxd.co. Hello! I’ve decided to do an analysis of all the major movies in Disney’s Animated Canon to try and gauge their likelihood of making it into KH3, or possibly other games. For the purposes of this analysis, I’ve stuck with movies/series that have never received a world, up until the cut-off point of Big Hero 6. I don’t think post BH6 movies should be completely disregarded, though, and I might come back to them in a later analysis. I also have not looked at Pixar yet, choosing only Disney’s. I have been trying to watch every single movie that has been released by Walt Disney Animation Studios, because I haven't watched many (or was too young to remember most of them that I had watched). I also LOVED Zootopia, it became my second favourite movie of 2016, and I became eager to watch every movie from WDAS. But after about 6 movies I started to become Disillusioned with Disney as a whole. I watched Cinderella, Lady and the Tramp, Frozen, Moana, The Jungle Book, and Beauty and the Beast. I would first like to start off by thanking all the wonderful people who have helped with my project, taking the time to give advice and explanations on how I should approach this difficult task. /u/shrekturself , /u/thawed_caveman , /u/eisbaerBorealis and anyone else I missed, thank you SO much, you guys are awesome! Unfortunately there's not a ton to update on at this point, but I thought I might as well keep you guys posted on the small developments that have taken place. Hello and good day, predditors! Welcome to Wagging Detail , a series of posts celebrating the mind-boggling attention to detail lavished upon the world of Zootopia by Walt Disney Animation Studios. I've reached the point where I'm automating ( the process of pulling up the movie, Imgur, and the apps I use to take and prepare screenshots. I may have a problem…it doesn't feel like I have a problem, but I may have a problem. :P #\#5: The Odd Slip-up# `← Previous. Was reading up on CES news this week and stumbled across an article mentioning 3D being dead. Last year 2016, nearly everyone stopped adding a 3D picture option to their set. I think LG might be the last company to provide 3D in a TV. Content is still being made, a new 3D Blu-ray comes out almost every other week. So why the change? Anyone disappointed? Which of you don't even care? Why don't manufactures just add in the feature whether you use it or not, similar to the addition of smart feature. So I've been seeing people doing this more and more here and they've inspired me. My name is Nick (yes. It actually is) and I'm an 18 year old in the US. When I first saw the advertisement for Zootopia, I honestly thought it looked kind of corny. A few days after it came out, I got a text from a friend, "I took my little brother to see Zootopia. Wait until you hear the new nickname I have for you" So of course this peeked my curiosity, and I watched it. And turns out. I LOVED IT!! I watched. So, I just recently graduated high school, and am waiting a year before I go to college to gain work experience and build some some finances to help pay for it. I've always wanted to go into Architecture, and have even taken classes on CAD, 3D modeling, and Revit (home design). My senior year, I had to do a video project for one of my classes. After it was presented, my teacher loved it, and asked me if I wanted to replace the school editing team to do a project on anti-bullying, and gun contro. 
Did anyone else pick up Disney's first Zootopia comic book? I heard about this during a panel at San Diego Comic-Con over the summer and I decided to support Zootopia by preordering it from my local comic shop. It's an inexpensive little book (.99) printed on cheap paper with four different kinds of content. EDIT: I was wrong about the proportions of content when I first posted this. I've revised my description below now that I've read part of the book. Note that the majority Hey everyone! My name is Heath Foley, I'm the founder and lead artist for Red Panda Miniatures!
