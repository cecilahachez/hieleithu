I feel like I relate to asian women the most because ever since I've been in america I've gotten harassed and disrespected by creepy white american men, especially older ones who hit on me even though I'm in my early 20s. For reference I'm a Russian female and I'm educated in an american university, in English fluent but have an accent.
