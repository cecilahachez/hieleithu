 I started my YouTube channel as a way for me to just start and have something in the world. I thought the only thing I could do or provide value to the world with is to talk about books. So I started to do that and I have been consistently making summaries every Friday for 5 weeks but I am not sure how to get my channel to have more viewers. I know that if you want to have a "decent" YouTube channel, you have to stay in the race for the long run (and 5 weeks is definitely An idea popped up in my head and it suprises me that this havn't been done already. Youtube is a site where companies that support SOPA can post their videos (for example game trailers) to make thier products sell better. Why don't we gather up and dislike the videos, upvoting a comment telling people that this company supports SOPA and what SOPA will do to the internet. If we get a few thousand dislikes on a video, it will give the viewer a bad impression of the company leading to less sells. hi guys im new to the community i would love to talk and get to know everybody more! :) if you guys have the time give me a brief introduction of your youtube channel and what you are all about. Hello readers- I'm not European but I imagine that if I were I would be much more hype if I knew that I could catch some segments of the show to be on during a time that's convenient to them- I realize how important the space of prime time is for American viewers, many of who have jobs during the daylight hours and look forward to watching certain Rollplay shows live or how the players day-schedules factor into how they schedule for shows. My advice is essentially to have some shows air during. 
hello im having an issue, i have an youtube channel connected to my gmail, it has over 1000subs but today when i logged into the ytube account, the account is not there. i only get an option of creating a new one? when i search for the exact channel name, its still avaible on youtube and still all videos are there and going. however its not longer connected to my email. i have not done anything or changed any settings, or transfered the account over to another email. what could came across a video on ytube that shows how the recoil changes affect semi auto rifle ,has a before /after comparison. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVufMuffUBY (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVufMuffUBY). Tried typing in 'Majors' (and Majores, Meigors, Mejores, and Mejors) on the M i s e s searches for their site and shop and the Gold and Black subreddit search AND a DukDukGo and found NOTHING! As an AVID AnCap-minded individual who wishes to expropriate the Federal Government and auction off the debt of communal property that shouldn't exist if it's not voluntary because of its problems compared to private property and eliminate push-pull factors of a given conundrum that produces sociopaths. Hey guys, Since it is BlackFriday I am looking for headphones for my Pc. I play alot of FPS games and want to hear where the enemy comes from for example (I know the game audio design matters alot but anyways). My mainboard is a z170 extreme 4. Onboard there is this equipment : 7.1 CH HD Audio (Realtek ALC1150 Audio Codec), Supports Purity Sound‚Ñ¢ 3 & DTS Connect I do not have an AMP or DAC and can't effort one at the moment. My budget are 100 euros (+-10). Do you have any advice. Hi , i work so hard on my new youtube channel , buy gear , hours of playing and recording and editing , but when it comes to sharing , i dont have a place to show my work ( because im too small so ppl woun't see my clips by searching engine ) , so my question is: HOW CAN I POST MY YTUBE LINK ON REDDIT ? BECAUSE EVERY SUBBREDIT THAT I POST , THE POST IT'S CANCELLED BECAUSE THEY DONT ALLOW SELF PROMOTING OR LINKS. 
''' #### Chappelle's Show - "Frontline" - Clayton Bigsby Pt. 1 - Uncensored ^^1 ##### 3,057,476 views üëç24,578 üëé593 Description: When a "Frontline" reporter tracks down the leading voice of the white supremacist movement, Clayton Bigsby, he's surprised by what he finds. Comedy Central, Published on Feb 23, 2018 ^(Beep Boop. I'm a bot! This content was auto-generated to provide Youtube details. Respond 'delete' to delete this.) ^( ) ^(Opt Out) ^^2 ^( ) ^(More Info). In this post, I will go through some bugs I found while taking pictures of several new construction changes introduced in the May 3rd PTS patch. There are memes added to keep you bored planetmans busy. Without further ado: Checkout the Imgur Link (https://imgur.com/a/9hMpxJM) for images of new Construction models.

So after several mods added and dampers put on the X and Y motors, my printer is really quiet, that is until diagonal infill starts. Then it gets this rattley/grindy noise. I'll try to get a video on ytube soon to explain it. I'm not sure if it's belt grind, a wonky bearing or what. Edit: Shoot, as soon as I go to video, infill finishes. I did get some video of the noise. Not necessarily from diagonal movement but you'll see\(hear\) what I mean. Video coming in a few min Edit2:. Hi guys! Started the game a week ago, level 13 atm so i've mostly played against bots but watched some pro games + guides and all that on youtube/twitch. One thing that i could not find is what is the job of the mid, top and bot laners ? From my understanding, the jungler is the roamer and the ganker and he helps with objectives, when you're killing enemies top/mid/bot you help a lot so they can push the tower. What about the top player ? Is he pushing his lane to get the tower 
2 bugs that would be great to life without: - the floating corpses the bug is there like forever :) ( example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAbbii4_u4k ) (//second this might be only a problem for me because I find no ytube vid for it. :) ) - when I repair the EV about 20% of the time I notice warping arround the EV. (you press f to repair and move at the same time and suddenly you are warped to the other side of the EV) -------------------- 2nd part: ranked vs pub rules: I have been playi. This might not be new but I've seen no one do it so far on YouTube etc. I can't post a video because of bandwidth issues but the combo is as follows. Tested mostly on screen edge but also works mid screen usually. This is done on an X-Box Controller with default controls. L = Light, M = Medium, H = Heavy, S = Special. Combo is L,L,M-Low,M-Stand, Diag. Up/Towards + L, M, Diag. Up/Towards + L, M, Down + H, H(Chase), L, M,M/L, Down/Away + H (1 Bar). When kick initiates from Down/Away + Heavy. any rappers in uw?? i make beats (i can also mix vocals). i can help you become the next lil pump. but in all seriousness, if you think you can actually rap/flow, let me know and we can work. ytube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESQmj6LuHLQ) soundcloud (https://soundcloud.com/youngjinofficial).
